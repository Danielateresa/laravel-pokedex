    <p>Pokémon is a global phenomenon. With merchandise in the forms of trading cards, clothing, and plushies, as well
        as mobile apps, anime, manga, and food (yes, even food), the franchise is virtually everywhere these days.
        Sitting comfortably at the top of the list of highest-grossing media franchises of all time and at second place
        (behind Mario, of course) on the list of best-selling video games of all time, it’s become apparent that these
        cute pocket monsters are here to stay. Hell, Pikachu’s ears and cheeks have become just as recognizable as
        Disney’s Mickey Mouse ears, so yeah—Pokémon is that iconic. But, what is now considered a pop culture mainstay
        wasn’t always the case.

        To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Pocket Monsters: Red & Green, Game Freak and Nintendo have released New
        Pokémon Snap and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl (a remake of the 2006’s Pokémon Diamond and Pearl)for
        the Nintendo Switch. So, to celebrate their celebration, we’re taking it back to the ’90s—the beginning of our
        Pokémon adventure—as we run down the history of the making of Pocket Monsters: Red and Green, and how it all
        began just 25 years ago.</p>

    <p>1996 brought us to the beginning of the revolution—the Pokémon revolution, that is. But, at first, the revolution
        was definitely not televised. Pocket Monsters: Red and Green was finally released in Japan on February 27th,
        1996, on a console that was already past its prime. Because of this, little to no press was done around the
        game; the media just wasn’t interested in covering a game that was exclusive to an archaic console. Nintendo saw
        the blood in the water and wasn’t expecting much of this little game. They planned to collect whatever minuscule
        amount of money they could from the newly released project and then move on from it. “No magazine or TV show was
        interested. They thought GameBoy was finished,” said Masakazu Kubo, the executive producer of the publishing
        company Shogakukan Inc. “No toymakers were interested [in Pokémon] either.” The final straw for the game came
        when the biggest tech companies in Japan began to make the move to CD-ROMs, which provided cleaner graphics and
        smoother fidelity. Corporate Japan was looking towards the future of gaming, a future that seemingly had no
        place for a time-displaced RPG called Pocket Monsters. Except, that’s where they were wrong.</p>

    <p>There was a faction of Japan’s population that the corporate suits forgot to consider when dealing with Pokémon:
        the youth. The young boys and girls in Japan were immediately attracted to Pocket Monsters: Red and Green when
        they first appeared on store shelves. Unlike CD-ROMs and the computers required to play them, Game Boy tech and
        games were much more affordable. Shogakukan Inc. saw the spell that Pokémon seemed to have cast on children, and
        decided that they were interested in backing the product after all. With that last hurdle out of the way, Pocket
        Monsters: Red and Green began to take off. Slowly but surely, the game was selling out all across Japan. That’s
        when Nintendo truly began to understand the vision of what Tajiri and Game Freak were trying to create. And they
        had finally succeeded. “That’s why it was originally conceived as a game that would be developed for this new
        hardware. Then there were substantial delays in completing the title,” said Ishihara during an interview with
        Satoru Iwata for Iwata Asks. “Still, as the producer, when I saw the content of Pocket Monsters: Red and Green,
        my personal feeling was that of all the titles I had experience of, that I had played or worked on as a
        producer, this was of the very highest caliber. That is to say, I was confident that this was streets ahead of
        the crowd in terms of sheer enjoyment.”</p>
